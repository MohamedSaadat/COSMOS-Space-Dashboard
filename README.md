📌 Project Overview

**The purpose of this project:**
- Asynchronous Data Fetching: Master the use of Fetch API to integrate multiple third-party services (NASA, SpaceDevs, and Solar System OpenData).
- Dynamic Content Rendering: Implement logic to transform JSON data into responsive HTML components (Cards, Modals, and Tables) using Tailwind CSS.
- Interactive Data Presentation: Build a seamless way to explore the solar system and upcoming rocket launches with real-time updates.
- Responsive Web Design: Ensure a flawless experience across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors, using Tailwind's utility-first approach.
- Clean Architecture: Practice writing modular JavaScript and maintaining a clean, organized project structure for better scalability.

## 🔧 How It Works (JavaScript Logic)

- **Today in Space Section** Displays the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" sourced directly from NASA's API. This section features a stunning daily space image accompanied by a detailed scientific explanation and metadata.
- **Launches Section** A real-time tracker for upcoming space missions using the SpaceDevs Launches API. It provides comprehensive details about each mission, including launch service providers, rocket types, and scheduled liftoff dates.
- **Planets Section** An interactive guide to our solar system powered by the Solar System OpenData API. This section presents all planets with key astronomical data such as gravity, dimensions, and orbital details in a visually appealing and organized layout.
